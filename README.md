# QUIZ CODE BY TIM HELLMAN


## USAGE
This is a quiz devoted to bizarre laws across the greater USA.  It is questionably functional and I am unquestionably confused by the output and design.  Scores will be stored in local storage; if you are able to retrieve them from storage, you are a far better coder than myself (which is why you are you reading this.)  Enjoy the confusion, lovely grader(s) of Trilogy.  

## CHALLENGES
I was generally confused with the variables upon variables, what variable corresponds with what (example: "question[currentQuestions]question.value")  Differentiating between everything became difficult and trying to explain my code became as confusing as writing it.       

## CONTRIBUTING
This is for contributions.  

## AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I worked on this with BCS Learning Assistants, tutor Chad Tao, classmates Kevin Fujimoto, Blake The Quake, and Haley Medina.  A good 20 hours were spent on this assignment, but I was not able to execute the full functionality required.
